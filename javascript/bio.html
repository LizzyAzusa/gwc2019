      <h2>Bio:</h2>
      <p>
        I am a girl who codes from Sumware, CA. I will be in the 12th grade in the fall, and I am looking forward to applying to colleges. I live at home with my mom, my brother, and my cat named Seymore. When I'm not coding, you can find me listening to music with my friends or reading.

      Side Scroller Project:

      Last week, I build a cool side scroller project in Scratch. To build it, I learned about storyboarding, graphic design and using the concepts of functions, loops, conditionals, and variables. Check out the screenshot below!
